# Summary of this development environment

wp-env / wp-scripts (experimental) / phpunit / playwright / linting (phpcs, phpstan, eslint, stylelint) / browser-sync

> NOTE: we have stylelint installed but we don't actually have any .css file yet.

## Dependencies

- Gravit Forms - it must be installed already under the folder /plugins

# Start to work:

```
npm i
composer install
npm run start
```

Start environment with
`wp-env start` or `wp-env start --xdebug`
with wp-eng installed globally. Once the containers are created, the next times you can use
```sh
npm run up (or > npx wp-env start)
```

you'll see somethign like this, where the MySQL ports might change.
```
WordPress development site started at http://localhost:8890
WordPress test site started at http://localhost:8891
MySQL is listening on port 49313
MySQL for automated testing is listening on port 49412
```
If the 5mins WordPress installation is triggered, see below **Troubles**.

Inside the docker container the MySQL ports are the regular 3306 and 3307 for testing. They are just mapped out.

the password for MySQL inside the wp-env docker container is 'password', for the user 'root'

You can use terminal commands in the wp-env with the wp-env cli commands:

`npx wp-env run cli wp option get siteurl` or `npx wp-env run cli -- wp option get siteurl`

> you can use `npm run wp-env ...` instead of `npx wp-env run ...`


or if you want to actually get inside the docker container and work locally, you will run

`npm run wp-env run cli sh -c`

---

You can install the demo sample page with:

Maybe you'll need to run
npx wp-env run cli -- wp plugin activate gravity-forms
npx wp-env run cli -- wp plugin activate coco-gravity-form-map-field

from here you can create dummy data, see `tests/class-create-dummy-data.php`, or import it with `npx wp-env run cli -- wp import wp-content/plugins/coco-gravity-form-map-field/themeunittestdata.wordpress.xml --authors=create`

## Developing

You will normally have one or two terminal windows running:

`npm run start` > uses wp-scripts to compile the block into /build and watch changes.

`npm run browser-sync` > if you want to work on `http://localhost:3000` and have the hot reload.

I suggest to watch the **e2e tests** as you work.
This can't be done right now in terminal (the watching), but you can do it either using the
playwright ui ( `npm run test -- --ui` ) or using the VSCode Playwright Test and activate the watch.

**PHP lint**

Lint your work. In a php file run the `composer lint <name.php>` and `composer format <name.php>` in any file.
Use `composer analize <name.php>` for deep linting.
From time to time run it for the whole project `composer lint .` and `composer format .`.

**JS lint**

With prettier, your files js and css should format automatically on save
(you shouldnt need to run `npm run lint:js`).

`npm run lint:js` - lints all files (for a reason in my last work it doesnt seem to work)

`npm run lint:css` - lints all files

## Summary: After making changes in js, css and php files

Linting formatting js, css, and php files.

For PHP
```
npm run format
composer lint .
composer analyze <name.php>
(or > npm run lint:php)
composer format .
```

Reccomended VSCode extensions
phpcs, phpcbf, eslint, stylelint, prettier

# PHPUNIT

- read `tests/readme-how-to-test.md`

it works, I copied it from the create-block-theme plugin, with some adaptations because this is a theme not a plugin. The file `bin/install-wp-tests.sh` is not used.

It's not really needed for this simple plugin, where there are no php functionalities or APIs on itself. You can run it individually or with watch

`npm run test:php`

`npm run test:php:watch`

or if WP Local instead of wp-env: ❯ WP_PHPUNIT__TESTS_CONFIG=tests/wp-config.php composer run test

# Playwright e2e tests

- read `tests/readme-how-to-text.md`

check the 'readme-how-to-test.md'. You'll find tips about how to test. There is an e2e test with dummy data.

`❯ npx playwright test --ui`

 or

 `npm run test:js`

 # Deploy the .zip plugin

We have included a git action to create a downloadbe zip of the plugin for 30 days after every push 
in the `main` branch, but you can create 

`node .github/scripts/build-plugin.js`

will create `dist/coco-gravity-form-map-field.zip` using the version from the comment in `coco-gravity-form-map-field.php`,
ready for distribution. (see more in ./bin/readme-bin.md)

# Continous Integration/ Development

There are Playwright tests, but still not integrated in the Pull Requests.  

We have a good linting exectued on every commit (js/css/phpcs).  

In a Pull Request, we execute the linting again, and also the PHPUnit tests.

In a merge, we execute the automatic version increase. By default we increase it as a patch (from x.y.2 to x.y.3).  
We can increase a minor and major version update by including in the merge commit: `[minor update]`/`[major update]`

# Troubles

- sometimes the enviroment of wp-env gets crazy and tries to find the assets of the block in :
http://localhost:8890/wp-content/themes/default/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/coco-gravity-form-map-field/build/blocks/aside-related-article/style-index.css?ver=1.0
	- I still don't know why it happens and how to fix it. I restart docker and push the env up again to fix it.

- Sometimes when creating the wp-env, the DB is not initialized. You can use wp cli to help
```
npx wp-env run cli wp db reset --yes
npx wp-env run cli wp core install --url="http://localhost:8890" --title="Mi Sitio WP" --admin_user="admin" --admin_password="password" --admin_email="admin@example.com"
npx wp-env run cli wp plugin activate coco-gravity-form-map-field
```

# Start a new plugin from this boilerplate

Original boilerplate: https://github.com/cobianzo/wp-env-sidebar-related-article

## Git clone and rename repo

clone the original repo: `https://github.com/cobianzo/wp-env-sidebar-related-article`
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin git@github.com:cobianzo/coco-gravity-form-map-field.git

## renaming

rename initial file to your plugin's: `coco-gravity-form-map-field`
replace all occurrences of the plugin's slug into `coco-gravity-form-map-field`
replace plugin name in the original php name.
rename references to the repo `https://github.com/cobianzo/wp-env-sidebar-related-article`
change description and other fields in `coco-gravity-form-map-field.php`

## tests renaming

delete in `tests/playwright` the current tests, and create you own
adapt the phpunit tests
decide if we need the page to create dummy data.

## cleanup and setup

remove `screenshots` files
`package.json`, remove packages you don't need.
setup  `.wp-env.json`  
setup husky with `npm run prepare`
add files to ignore in linting: .stylelintignore, .eslintrc, 

## Start working (read the documentation in README.md)

npm install, composer install
npm run prepare
start docker and npm run up
start testing phpUnit and e2e.
run lintings
npm run browser-sync

## Make 1st commit and confirm husky work

## Make a pull request and confirm that the PHPCS and PHPUnit test run

## Make first push and confirm plugin version increments and the zip is created.


## Finally 

Recreate the README-plugin.txt, README.md
Edit `build-plugin.js` to use the right files on the creation of the distribution plugin.


# TODO

- Add translations
- Add more options to the field: hide lookup, hide location button ...
	- Important: add an option for initial position of the map on page load
- We need CI/CD for Playwright
- Improve the github actions: use cache or artifacts to avoid repeating npm run build etc.
- Move the artifact to an S3 bucket or a repo for the distribution.
- Refactor to typescript
- Transform most of the styles in the css into json styles, with variations.
- Extend the tests for mobile devices and for other wordpress versions/themes
